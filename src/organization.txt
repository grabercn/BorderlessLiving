How It Works
CountryHome.js
This container holds your shared state (like the selected country, notes, favorites, map settings, etc.) and passes callbacks and data as props to the DrawerMenu and MapComponent.
It also handles the welcome and country detail modals.

DrawerMenu.js
This component encapsulates your side menu logic using Ant Designâ€™s Menu and a bit of Framer Motion for animation. 
It accepts props for settings (like toggling map type and note import/export) and for displaying lists (countries, favorites, and notes). 
It also calls a provided onCloseDrawer callback when items are clicked.

MapComponent.js
This component renders the map using pigeon-maps. 
It displays country markers (using flags) and note markers (with grouping logic) and handles map events like click and bounds changes. 
All map-related properties (center, zoom, etc.) and callbacks are passed from CountryHome.
